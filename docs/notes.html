Notes
================

I'm going to write a bootloader. 

First, I'm going to look at xv6 and see how the group at PDOS did it. 

Boot process:
    - Upon powering on, most x86 machines kick off by soliciting the BIOS chip. 
    - The BIOS chip then transfers control to the designated **boot sector**. 
    - The **boot sector** is the first 512 bytes on the boot disk. 

Registers:
    - While simulating an Intel 8088, there are
        - 8 16bit general-purpose registers
            - %ax return register :)
        - 4 16bit segment registers
            - %cs for instruction fetches
            - %ds data read/write
            - %es "extra" segment? idk what this is
            - %ss stack read/write
        - processor sends 20 bits of address to memory, which come from segment register + gp register

how is it that a process can have a new program exec()ed onto it? the answer is the ELF format.

xv6
================

So xv6 consists of 102 files. 

Of these files, 8 are used directly as part of the boot process:
    - bootasm.S
        - memlayout.h
        - mmu.h
        - asm.h
    - bootmain.c
        - types.h
        - elf.h
        - x86.h

nvm the xv6 printout actually divides up all the files into 11 categories


NASM bootloader (6/13)
================

- The alleged "bootloader" is loaded into memory at 0x007c00
- The alleged "bootloader" should be 512 bytes in length, meaning the next available address should be 0x007e00
- So what if instead of starting our "stack" at 7CO, we started it at 0x7e00?

Let's map this out:
   bootloader...stack.......sp
---|------------|-----------|---
   0x7c00 (512) 0x7e00 (8k) 0x2000

- ds holds address where data region starts

BIOS interrupts:
================
- `0x10` has a bunch of video stuff
- `0x13` has a ton of disk stuff
- `0x16` has a bunch of keyboard stuff
- `0x1A` has a bunch of time stuff

A note about stack stuff:
=========================
- Caller-save:
    - Only needed if the calling function needs to reference its local data after callee function returns. 
    - Save registers before calling another function, restored after callee returns
    - This is the responsibility of the caller. 
- Callee-save:
    - Always do this!

Example... in boot.S:
    1. push bp to stack
    2. mov bp <- sp (base is set to top of stack (aka sp))
    3. push all general-purpose registers to stack
    4. { do stuff }
    5. restore (aka pop) all general-purpose registers
    6. mov sp <- bp (top of stack is now what it should be, is this really necessary though?)
    7. pop bp
    8. stack is now what it was before function ran

Also another cool thing I discovered: there's an x86 instruction called RDTSC that measures clock cycles. 

Commands:
=========
Assemble:
```
$ nasm -f bin src/boot.S -o boot.out
```
Run on bochs:
```
$ bochs -f bochsrc.txt
```
Run on qemu:
```
$ qemu-system-i386 -fda boot.out
```

Names:
======

- PathOS
    - Performant and Theoretically Helpful Operating System
- LogOS
    - Logically Organized Generative Operating System
- EthOS
    - Eternally Theologically Heretical Operating System
    - Existentially Threatened 


Processor Modes:
================
- Real Mode: 
    - 16-bit registers
    - 1 MB memory
    - **segment:offset** memory model
        - (segment*16 + offset) = exact memory address
    - stuff is unsafe

- Protected Mode: 
    - 32-bit registers
    - 4 GB RAM
    - a bit trickier, easy to triple fault

- Unreal Mode:
    - basically Real Mode with 4 GB memory
    - kind of a hack

- Virtual 8086 Mode
    - Protected Mode with a simulated Real Mode
    - allows use of BIOS interrupts (only available in Real Mode)
